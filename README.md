- **RIGIDITY:**

  A change in the code might affect other parts of the code

  A change might lead to things breaking in unrelated places
  
- **IMMOBILITY:**

  Not being able to use the code outside of it's original context

## It's an abbreviation for the following:

- [**" S "**  Single responsibility principle](#single-responsibility-principle-)
- [**" O "**  Open closed principle](#open-closed-principle-)
- [**" L "**  Liskov substitution principle](#liskov-substitution-principle-)
- [**" I "**  Interface segregation principle](#interface-segregation-principle-)
- [**" D "**  Dependency inversion principle](#dependency-inversion-principle-)
